{# Ability to add another Google Analytics tracking code on a page with the Google Analytics taxonomy. 
As of 2022, only CV uses this. #}
{# 
  We don't want to actually print the taxonomy terms for Google Analytics.
  Instead, we build up dynamic script tags for each taxonomy term that hooks into Google Analytics.

  Google analytics scripts are generated via /macros/analytics.html.twig

  The Google Analytics field should be set to display as a rendered entity.

{% import "@coffey/macros/analytics.html.twig" as analytics %}

{% for key, item in element if key|first != '#' %}
    {% if item["#taxonomy_term"].field_ga_tracking_id is not null %}
      {% set trackingId = item["#taxonomy_term"].field_ga_tracking_id.getValue()[0]["value"] %}
      {{ analytics.scripts(trackingId) }}
    {% endif %}
